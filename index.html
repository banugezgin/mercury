<h1 id="header1">Welcome to Banu's Astrology Blog!</h1>

<hr/>

<p class="mainpagetext">Since discovering astrology in 2017, my journey has been nothing short of captivating. I had the privilege of receiving training from the esteemed Baris Ilhan at the Ilhan Astrology Institute, which served as the foundation for my ever-growing passion for this ancient art. Over the years, I have delved deep into the mysteries of the cosmos, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p class="mainpagetext">In 2019, I embraced a new role as the secretary in the NCGR Turkey branch, further immersing myself in the astrological community. This experience has allowed me to connect with fellow enthusiasts, exchange ideas, and contribute to the field in meaningful ways. It has been an enriching journey, nurturing my love for astrology and deepening my commitment to its exploration.</p>

<p class="mainpagetext">One area of astrology that has captivated me in particular is Harmonic Astrology. This relatively young approach to Western Astrology, dating back to the 1960s, offers a fresh perspective and provides deeper insights into interplanetary aspect patterns. Through the application of harmonic methodology, we venture into new qualities by dividing the astrological circle into prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on. This unique viewpoint opens up a whole new dimension, illuminating different layers of an individual's soul and shedding light on their true essence.</p>

<p class="mainpagetext">In this blog, I aim to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights into the fascinating world of astrology. Join me as we explore the celestial tapestry and uncover the profound connections between the cosmos and our individual lives. Together, we will embark on a journey of self-discovery, empowerment, and spiritual growth through the lens of astrology.</p>

<p class="mainpagetext">So, whether you're a seasoned astrology enthusiast or just beginning to dip your toes into this vast universe of knowledge, I invite you to join me on this transformative quest. Let's unlock the secrets of the stars and embark on a remarkable voyage of self-awareness and cosmic understanding.</p>

<p class="mainpagetext">Stay tuned for exciting updates, informative articles, and intriguing discussions that will deepen your understanding of astrology and its profound impact on our lives. May the stars guide us on this extraordinary journey!</p>

<p class="mainpagetext">With celestial blessings,</p>
